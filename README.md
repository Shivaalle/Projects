The surge in user comments on YouTube channels poses a challenge for content creators seeking relevant and engaging feedback[1]. Addressing this, our project introduces a unique analysis framework utilizing machine learning. We combine sentiment analysis and sentence type classification to categorize YouTube comments, aiding creators in enhancing viewer engagement. Distinct from prior studies, we tailor our approach to the specific characteristics of YouTube comments. Leveraging machine learning models like Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression, along with established statistical measures, we evaluate their performance using cross-validation and achieve impressive accuracies of 96.14% (Logistic Regression) and 97.33% (Random Forest). This comprehensive technique provides content creators with a powerful tool to navigate and leverage the vast volume of user comments, thereby enriching their channels and viewer interaction.
